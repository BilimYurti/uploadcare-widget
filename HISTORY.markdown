* Fixed XHR requests: added responseType to XHR requests

  crop auto applies to a last uploaded file.

### 3.1.4, 22.09.2017

* Fixed the error of the stream from a webcam in Safari 11.

* Updated function for start the stream from a webcam:
  added using the `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia` method
  if a browser supports these.

* Updated the video element, which used for the stream:
  use the `muted` attribute in HTML template instead of
  setting up the `volume` property in JS.

* Fixed stop video stream: if a browser supports the `getTracks` method,
  call the `stop` only for tracks, not for the stream,
  because MediaStream.stop deprecated.

* Fixed preview images in the list of files in `multiple` mode:
  using just one double-sized version of an image in `src` instead of
  using `srcset` attribute. Now there are high-quality images in browsers
  that don‚Äôt support the `srcset` attribute.

  (instead of triggering resolving).

* `dialogApi.onSwitched` is removed in favor of `dialogApi.progress`
  and tab name.
